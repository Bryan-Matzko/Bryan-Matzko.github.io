            Apart from spending my free time working on side projects and learning new programming languages, I can be 
            found at the CrossFit gym I go to, outdoors playing sports and going to the beach or watching hockey, 
            basketball and baseball. All of which I love to do with friends and family. I try  my best at everything I 
            do which gives me new goals I can strive towards every day. I also love listening to any music I can work out 
            to or Country music. I also love to read books, my mind is open to anything that I might find interesting 
            whether it be fiction or non-fiction!

                              <div class="subheading mb-3">Miovision</div>
                            
                              <p>
                                Currently I work on the legacy developement team at Miovision, a company looking to aid in 
                                the developement of smart cities through the use of traffic data and traffic operations. 
                                My team's goal is to improve the tooling of older products supported by the company. The 
                                legacy team helps improves the performance of these older products and counters, we also 
                                look to make the customer experience more enjoyable. The majority of my work revolves 
                                around the company's QAP product, a tool that allows for counters to record traffic data 
                                from videos uploaded by external customers from the Company's traffic cameras. My main 
                                goal for QAP is to update the tool's workflow, improve performance, automate certain 
                                processes and support the data services team as issues and concerns rise. There are many 
                                exciting wins our team has obtained within the first two months of me working at this 
                                amazing company!
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                One big win was the creation of algorithms to provide counter's with intuitive default key 
                                bindings based on historically tracked data. The default keybindings reduce user setup 
                                time and are created for nearly all possible traffic intersection configurations. I also 
                                created processes that take into account a counter's historical count tasks and provides 
                                defaults that match their ecent personalized keybindings. One of my future goals is to find 
                                a way to provide counters with similar tasks, allowing for their historical defaults to 
                                have even greater benifits in the reduction of counter setup time.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Another large win is the improvements made to the company's auto acceptance algorithms. 
                                This algorithm takes into account the resultant data from both the counter's count data 
                                and the overlap data that is recorded by a more experienced counter. Historical data was 
                                analyzed to determine what is considered to be the thresholds for the company's data 
                                acceptance standards. The findings were used to create strict filtering on count results. 
                                The changes to the original algorithms reduced the  number of data comparisons admins 
                                were forced to conduct manually all the while improving the processes that the data must 
                                be run through. Algorithms were also created to automatically trigger task redo creations 
                                on tasks whose data fell below a specified accuracy threshold. By autocreating redos, 
                                admins saved a lot more time allowing for the most stressful days to go by without the 
                                fear of missing turnaround times. Future improvements for these changes will require that 
                                we teach the computer how to accept more tasks, allowing us to handle the majority of 
                                recurring cases that happen in production.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Another one of my team's goals is to run weekly releases involving feature flags. These 
                                flags hide our incremental margin work to improve all aspects of QAP. As features are 
                                created and tested, the feature flags allow us to instantly provide our users with 
                                new features. These are two things that have never been done on QAP, especially during 
                                a busy count season I am working during.

                            <p>
                              I spent two terms at FleetCarma working on the .NET team as a software developer. FleetCarma 
                              is a company with the goal of driving electric vehicle adoption around the world. Their main
                              product was a device that plugs into the OBD port in any car. The device has the capability
                              of recording vast data which is received and decoded using different services inside their
                              technological pipeline. Spending 8 months at FleetCarma was amazing as I was able to touch a
                              vast majority of the services and solutions the company has to offer. The majority of my 
                              work was backend development, however I did fiddle around with React every now and then.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Some of the tasks I worked on include the creation and improvements of the many 
                              microservices, APIs, Azure Functions, backend services and unit/integration tests. I had the 
                              opportunity of making large contributions to specific company programs/products such as the 
                              Fleet Management Portals, Smart Charge Rewards Program and the Smart Charge Manager Program. 
                              I was also able to work on vital components of the company's battery state of health 
                              calculator/algorithm and VIN decoder, both of which are key components of their products.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Some of my favorite work here focused on database improvements and migrations. I created a 
                              multitude of stored procedures, database migrations written in MS SQL and created/improved 
                              important tables. One of my larger database migrations involved refactoring related vehicle
                              information tables to enable association of trim levels retrieved from VINs for all vehicles, 
                              a key factor in determining more granular vehicle data based on model specifications. I also 
                              created proof of concepts and created all the plans to remove the need for a seperate database 
                              used for analytics in the Fleet Management Portals. My plans allowed for OLTP and analytics 
                              workloads to use the same database. This allows for the real time operational analytics. All 
                              this was achieved through research into indices, columnstore indices and analysis of the 
                              current database schema. Performance after my proposed changes resulted in queries that ran 
                              in less than 1% of the original runtime whilst being more accurate in the obtained 
                              information.

                              During my time at Trapeze Groue I worked on an ASP.NET Core project which reciprocated 
                              a file explorer of sorts. This tool was to be used as an internal tool that could allow
                              users to download products and tools wherever and whenever they wished (as long as they)
                              had valid credentials. I performed perfomance analysis on the project and significantly 
                              improved the app's run-times by analyzing/improving code.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Some fun items I worked on were the improvement and addition of widgets the team used in
                              their different projects. I also converted some legacy code to be more modern, for example
                              I converted HTML Helpers to Tag Helpers and I created editor and display templates as needed. 
                              I worked on both front-end and backend code using C#, JavaScript, jQuery, cshtml, html and 
                              and css.

                            <p>
                              My very first co-op opportunity was at RedIron, a company that deals with retail solution 
                              innovations. To get to know some of their products and solutions better, my first tasks
                              revolved around adding features and fixing bugs to a tool that helped create automated 
                              scripts for retail POS solutions. This work involved a lot of learning on how to create
                              useful unit tests while improving my basic knowledge of coding practices. While working on
                              this, I was able to add functionality to older extensions.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Upon learning how the various applications worked, my next task was to create a new extension 
                              that enabled communication between a new VeriFone device the company hadn't yet worked with 
                              and drivers using web services. During my time here, I worked a lot with C#, xml and xslt. 
                              This being my first co-op, gave me a lot of new insights regarding how I improve my code and 
                              for that, I will always be thankful!

                              <p>
                                I've always had a bone to pick with fitness trackers that I use for working out. I love 
                                features that some apps have, but I have never found a single app that has all the 
                                features I would like to have during my workouts. In turn, I have started to design my own 
                                personal IOS application that I can use in the gym. I have a lot of ideas for my app, 
                                however I started with the basics. My first goal was to run basic timer types such as 
                                For Time Timers, EMOMs, AMRAPs and Tabatas. Further goals for my app include adding 
                                features so that users can combine different types of timers together while including rest 
                                periods inbetween workouts. The user would be able to combine a number of different timers 
                                together, a feature I would love to have on the apps I currently use. Furthermore I would 
                                love to allow users to record PRs, track strength progressions on main movements from week 
                                to week and easily determine weight percenteages in a easy to use and nice looking way.

                              <p>
                                Everyone who has met me knows that I am a fitness fanatic, I'm always looking for ways to 
                                improve in every aspect of my life. I am also one of the firm believers that a lot of 
                                information can be extracted from a wearable technological device that can provide insights 
                                to many aspects of health and performance. Because of this I was instantly entranced with 
                                learning how activity trackers and heart rate sensors work.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                I began doing research into how optical heart rate sensors work. I bought an optical heart 
                                rate sensor and attached it to an arduino to determine what I could learn from the readings. 
                                I created algorithms to detect peaks in the data and determine heart rate variability based 
                                on RMSSD calculations. I loved learning about different theories and the backed research I 
                                read. My next goal with this side project is to prototype a similar optical heart rate 
                                sensor, attach it to a BLE nano and provide information via bluetooth to either a phone or 
                                computer. This work is all out of personal interest and my end goal is to determine how I 
                                can reduce the noise resulting in movement of a user wearing the device and reduce the 
                                device's size while performing addequately for my personal lifestyle.

                              <p>
                                Another thing I have been looking into with this project is the research that backs the 
                                proposed correlation between wearables and certain aspects of health. This includes how 
                                certain devices track sleep, heart rate, and calories burnt by device owners.
                              </p>

                                During my first year in University, one of our main projects was to take a Lego NXT and 
                                accomplish something with it. Specifications for the project were slim, we had the 
                                opportunity to create anything we wanted. My group, consisting of Jason Kim and Jessen 
                                Liang,made a robotic arm that sorted items of different colours into corresponding bins. 
                                The arm held the shape of a claw that was designed to pick up objects from a ramp. Using 
                                sensors, motors and gear systems, the arm would determine the colour of the item and 
                                place said item into a colour correlated bin.
