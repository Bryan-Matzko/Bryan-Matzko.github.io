          <p>
              Apart from spending my free time working on side projects and learning new programming languages, I can 
              be found at the CrossFit gym I go to, outdoors playing sports and going to the beach or watching hockey, 
              basketball and baseball. All of which I love to do with friends and family. I try my best at everything I 
              do which gives me new goals I can strive towards daily. I love listening to any music I can work out to 
              and anything Country. I also enjoy reading books, my mind is open to anything that I might find interesting 
              whether it be fiction or non-fiction!

                              <p>
                                Currently I work on the legacy development team at Miovision, a company looking to aid in the rise of 
                                smart cities through the use of traffic data and traffic operations. My team's goal is to improve the 
                                tooling of some of the older products/solutions provided by the company. The legacy team also helps 
                                improve the performance of these older products and the company's traffic data counters, while making 
                                the customer experience more enjoyable. 
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                The majority of my work revolves around the company's QAP product, a tool that allows for counters to 
                                record traffic data from videos uploaded by external customers from cameras. My main goal for QAP is 
                                to update the tool's workflow, improve performance, automate processes and support the data services 
                                team as issues and concerns rise. The  There are many exciting wins our team has obtained during my 
                                short time here!
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                One exciting piece of work I did was creating algorithms to provide counter's with intuitive default 
                                key bindings based on historical data. The default key bindings reduce user setup time and are available 
                                for nearly all traffic intersection configurations. I also created processes that take into account the
                                bindings that a counter has used during their session. The cached data is used to speed up future tasks
                                by using the counter's personal patterns. I am currently working on a new task fetcher that will provide
                                counters with similar tasks, allow user's to reserve tasks and implement safeguards to ensure duplicate 
                                tasks arent assigned to agents. The benifits of this new task assigner will highlight the intuitive 
                                default and historical default work while improving agent fetch times.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                Another large win is the improvements made to the company's auto acceptance algorithms. These algorithms 
                                take into account the resultant data from both the counter data and verification data that is recorded by
                                high level agents. Historical data was analyzed to determine thresholds for the data acceptance standards. 
                                The findings were used to create strict restrictions for data acceptance and requirements were provided 
                                for the new algorithm. The changes to the original algorithms reduced the number of data comparisons admins 
                                were forced to conduct manually and prevented tasks from being accepted that shouldn't didn't meet the 
                                standards. Algorithms were also created to automatically trigger task redo creations on tasks whose data 
                                fell below a specified accuracy threshold. This also reduces the amount of manual work required by admins. 
                                As we learn more about the data that is still being accepted, I will be adding new rules and cases that 
                                increase acceptance rates while holding up the company standards.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                Throughout the term I have made huge strides towards mitigating risk during development with the aid 
                                of feature flags, well rounded unit tests and fallbacks. This has allowed me to schedule weekly releases
                                with impactful feature improvements and bug fixes. Previously, releases were done several times a year.
                                This is made possible by working closely with stakeholders, I have been running weekly meetings, analyzing 
                                and planning potential work and I have taken the lead role on the majority of releases.

                            <p>
                              I spent two terms at FleetCarma working on the .NET team as a software developer. FleetCarma 
                              is a company with the goal of driving electric vehicle adoption around the world. Their main
                              product is a device that plugs into the OBD port in any car. The device has the capability
                              of recording vast data which is received and decoded using different services inside their
                              technological pipeline. Spending 8 months at FleetCarma was amazing as I was able to touch a
                              vast majority of the services (including legacy code) and solutions the company has to offer. 
                              The majority of my work was backend development, however I did fiddle around with React every 
                              now and then.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Some of the tasks I worked on include the creation and improvements of the many 
                              microservices, APIs, Azure Functions, backend services and unit/integration tests. I had the 
                              opportunity of making large contributions to specific company programs/products such as the 
                              Fleet Management Portals, Smart Charge Rewards Program and the Smart Charge Manager Program. 
                              I was also able to work on vital components of the company's battery state of health 
                              calculator/algorithm and VIN decoder, both of which are key components of their products.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Some of my favorite work here focused on database improvements and migrations. I created a 
                              multitude of stored procedures, database migrations using SQL Server and I created/improved 
                              many important tables. One of my larger database migrations involved refactoring related vehicle
                              information tables to enable the association of trim levels retrieved from VINs for all vehicles, 
                              the vehicle trim is a key factor in determining more granular vehicle data based on model 
                              specifications. I also created proof of concepts and created all the plans to remove the need for 
                              a separate database used for analytics in the Fleet Management Portals. My plans allowed for OLTP 
                              and analytics workloads to use the same database. This allows for the real time operational analytics. 
                              All this was achieved through research into indexes (such as columnstore indexes) and analysis of the 
                              current database schema. Performance after my proposed changes resulted in queries that ran 
                              in less than 1% of the original runtime whilst being more accurate in the obtained information.

                            <p>
                              During my time at Trapeze Group I worked on an ASP.NET Core MVC project which reciprocated 
                              a file explorer of sorts. This tool was to be used as the company's file management system 
                              and allow employees to download solutiions and tools for personal use or for distribution. 
                              From the original code that was written, I was able to reduce app load times by up to 18x
                              through code and performance analysis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Other things I worked on include improving and adding widgets that the team used in different
                              web applications. I converted legacy code to follow more modern standards, such as the use of
                              tag helpers from previous HTML helpers. I created editor and display templates for various 
                              applications. During the term I worked on both front-end and backend code using C#, JavaScript, 
                              jQuery, CSHTML, HTML and CSS.

                              My very first co-op opportunity was at RedIron, a company that deals with retail solution 
                              innovations. To get to know some of their products and solutions better, my first tasks
                              revolved around adding features and fixing bugs to a tool that helped create automated 
                              scripts for retail POS solutions. This work involved a lot of learning on how to create
                              useful unit tests while improving my basic knowledge of coding practices. While working on
                              this, I was able to add functionality to older extensions.

                            <p>
                              Upon learning how the various applications worked, my next task was to create a new extension 
                              that enabled communication between a new VeriFone device, the company hadn't yet worked with, 
                              and drivers using web services. During my time here, I worked with C#, XML and XSLT.

                              <p>
                                  Every fitness timer app I have used has had something awesome I found helpful, however, I
                                  have always wanted a timer that includes the best features from various apps. In turn, I have 
                                  started to design my own personal IOS application that I can use at the gym. The app is still 
                                  in progress, but it will include all the features I have ever found useful!
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  I have a lot of ideas floating around in my head for the app, however I started with the basics. 
                                  My first goal was to run basic timer types such as For Time, EMOMs, AMRAPs and Tabataâs. This 
                                  was done using editable text fields that opened picker views. These picker views allow for users 
                                  to select work/rest durations, rounds, and total time to run. I purposefully made the code for 
                                  the single timer pickers non-reusable. This was a learning excersize to familiarize myself with 
                                  a somewhat complex handling of different pickers. The first phase of my app was a fun challenge
                                  that familiarized me with Swift.
                              </p>

                              <div>
                                <div class="portfolio-centered-content">

                              <p>
                                  My next step for this project was to enable the ability to combine multiple timers. This 
                                  involved creating re-usable code that can be used in the various timer setup views. I was 
                                  able to combine multiple AMRAP and For Time timers that users can use.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                  Further goals for my app include adding rest periods between timers, allowing for EMOMs 
                                  and tabataâs to be used in the combinational timers, fixing memory leaks and improving 
                                  the UI in the combinational timer views and the run timer view. Furthermore I would love 
                                  to allow users to record PRs, track strength progressions on main movements and easily 
                                  determine weight percentages in an easy to use and visually appealing form. All of these 
                                  non-timer features would be located in a new tab of the application.

                              <p>
                                Everyone who has met me knows that I am a fitness fanatic, I'm always looking for ways to 
                                make improvements in every aspect of my life. I am also one of the firm believers that a lot 
                                of information can be extracted from wearable technological devices that provide insights
                                into our body and health. Because of this I was instantly entranced with the idea of learning 
                                how activity trackers and heart rate sensors work.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                I bought an optical heart rate sensor and attached it to an Arduino to see what I could learn 
                                from the signals. I started to create algorithms that detect peaks in the data. With enough 
                                peaks, I started writing algorithms to detect heart rate variability based on RMSSD 
                                calculations. I have loved learning about different theories and the research on these topics. 
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                My next goal with this side project is to prototype a similar optical heart rate sensor on a
                                PCB, attach it to a BLE Nano and provide information via Bluetooth to either a phone or 
                                computer. This work is all out of personal interest and I am excited to learn how I 
                                can reduce the noise resulting in movement of the user and minimize the device's size while 
                                being able to perform adequately for my personal lifestyle.

                              <p>
                                Another thing I have been looking into with this project is the research that backs the 
                                proposed correlation between wearables and certain aspects of health. This includes how 
                                certain devices track sleep, heart rate, and calories burnt throughout the day.

                              <p>
                                During my second year in University, I took a numerical methods course, one of our projects
                                was to solve a problem that may be found in the real world. My group decided to take a 3 joint
                                robotic arm and determine the angles the are would need to make in order for the tip of the 
                                arm to be at the specified location. Several simplifications/assumptions were made and MATLAB 
                                scripts were written to first determine the divergence regions for the matrix representation of
                                the system. From my findings, I wrote a C# application was written that was able to take any point
                                and determine all possible angles the joint could make to reach the desired position.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                I took all the MATLAB code and re-wrote it in C#. I made my own functions to manipulate matrices, 
                                and solve systems of equations then wrote a console application and a web application to display 
                                my results in different forms for presentations. The original MATLAB code took over 24 hours to run
                                a basic solution. My C# code was able to perform all of the same calculations in under 10 seconds.
                                This then allowed me to increase the standards for my solutions and run more complicated scenarios. 
                                At one point I had a program that would take into account the error approximation the user wanted and 
                                the application would determine all angles withing the provided tolerance that provided a solution. 
                                This was outside the scope of our proposed project description and I removed the code for submission 
                                for the mandatory presentation my group did.

                              <p>
                                During my first year in University, one of our main projects was to take a Lego NXT and 
                                accomplish something with it. Specifications for the project were slim, we had the 
                                opportunity to create anything we wanted. My group, consisting of Jason Kim and Jessen 
                                Liang, made a robotic arm that sorted items of different colours into corresponding bins. 
                                The arm held the shape of a claw that was designed to pick up objects from a ramp. Using 
                                sensors, motors and gear systems, the arm would determine the colour of the item and 
                                place said item into a colour correlated bin.
