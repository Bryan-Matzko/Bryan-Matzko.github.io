              I'm a 3rd-year Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo looking for internship 
              opportunities in the software industry. I am a self-starter and very goal oriented. I hope to learn 
              as much as I can during my final work term from the company and the software team I work with. I am 
              passionate about all the work I do and am looking to make an impact in any industry I work in!

          <p>
              Apart from spending my free time working on side projects and learning new programming languages, I can 
              be found at the CrossFit gym I go to, outdoors playing sports and going to the beach or watching hockey, 
              basketball, and baseball. All of which I love to do with friends and family. I try my best at everything I 
              do which gives me new goals I can strive towards daily. I love listening to any music I can work out to 
              and anything Country. I also enjoy reading books, my mind is open to anything that I might find interesting 
              whether it be fiction or non-fiction!

                                My final co-op term at Motorq was my first official experience in a product management position.
                                During this term I worked closely with the CEO and COO to determine goals, prioritize work, 
                                analyze research findings and finalize requirements for specific phase implementations. Additionally,
                                I communicated with customers through a variety of means to understand existing concerns, desired 
                                products and potential use cases.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                I advanced product efforts through the creation of many product requirement documents and worked
                                closely with the remote engineering team to implement and roll out new features and products. Once
                                implementations were done, I wrote tests through a variety of means (python/excel/C#) to ensure 
                                exceptional data quality was being provided to the customer.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                During the term, I made efforts to improve existing data quality through the analysis of large data
                                sets. One main example was my developement and implementation of algorithms that detected and filtered 
                                noise in specific vehicle signals. This was done as a proof of concept before the engineering team 
                                implemented the final product. I later improved my proof of concept to be user friendly for colleagues
                                to use for future testing.

                              <p>
                                My co-op at Miovision was one of my favorites due to the volume and complexity of work. Miovision 
                                is a company looking to aid in the rise of smart cities through the use of traffic data and traffic 
                                operations. My team's goal was to improve the tooling and performance of the older products/solutions 
                                provided by the company. These improvements were made to help the company's traffic data counters'
                                become more efficient and to make the customer experience more enjoyable.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                The majority of my work revolved around the company's QAP product, a tool that allows for counters 
                                to record traffic data from videos uploaded by external customers from cameras. The application 
                                also allows admins to accept and publish data for customers. My main goals for QAP were to update 
                                the tool's workflow, improve performance, automate processes and support the data services team as 
                                issues/concerns came up. There are many exciting wins the team made during my short time with them!
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                One exciting piece of work I did was the creation of algorithms to provide intuitive default key 
                                bindings to counters. The defaults were based on historical data and reduced user setup time. The 
                                defaults were made available for all traffic intersection configurations. I also created processes 
                                that take into account the bindings that a counter has used during their session current session. 
                                The cached data is used in future tasks and helped speed up setup times. During the end of my term, 
                                I designed and started implementing a new task fetcher using an AWS Lambda. The task  
                                fetcher will provide counters with similar tasks, allow users to reserve tasks and implement 
                                safeguards to ensure duplicate tasks aren't assigned to agents. The fetcher also improved the use of
                                locks resulting in shorter fetch times and reducing possible queue back up. The benefits of this new 
                                task assigner will also highlight the intuitive default and historical default work while increasing 
                                the possible task fetches per minute.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                Another huge win was the improvements I made to the company's auto acceptance algorithms. These 
                                algorithms take into account the resultant data from both the counter data and verification data. 
                                Historical data acceptance results were analyzed to determine thresholds for the data acceptance 
                                standards. The findings were then used to create constraints for the new algorithm. The changes to 
                                the original algorithms reduced the number of data comparisons admins performed manually and 
                                prevented tasks from being accepted that didn't meet the standard. Algorithms were also created to 
                                automatically trigger task redo creations on tasks that didn't match the verification data close 
                                enough. This also reduces the amount of manual work required by admins.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                Throughout the term, I made huge strides towards mitigating risk during development with the aid 
                                of feature flags, well-rounded unit tests, and fallbacks. This allowed me to schedule weekly 
                                releases with impactful feature improvements and bug fixes. Something that no other team at the 
                                company has been able to achieve before. This was all made possible by working closely with 
                                stakeholders, I ran weekly meetings, analyzed and planned potential work and I took the lead role 
                                on releases.

                            <p>
                              I spent two terms at FleetCarma working on the .NET team as a software developer. FleetCarma's 
                              goal is to drive electric vehicle adoption around the world. Their main product is a device 
                              that plugs into a car and records vehicle metrics. Spending 8 months at FleetCarma was amazing, 
                              I was able to touch the vast majority of the company's services and solutions. I was also able 
                              to modify a lot of the legacy projects. The majority of my work was backend development, 
                              however, I did fiddle around with React every now and then.

                              Some of the tasks I worked on include the creation and improvements of the many microservices,
                              APIs, Azure Functions, backend services and unit/integration tests. I had the opportunity of 
                              making large contributions to specific company programs/products such as the Fleet Management 
                              Portals, Smart Charge Rewards Program and the Smart Charge Manager Program. I was also able to 
                              work on vital elements of the company's battery state of health calculator/algorithm and VIN 
                              decoder, both of which are key components of their products.

                              Some of my favorite work focused on database improvements and migrations. I created a multitude 
                              of stored procedures, database migrations (using SQL Server) and tables/table improvements. One 
                              of my larger database migrations involved refactoring related vehicle information tables to 
                              enable the association of trim levels. I also created proof of concepts and the required epic 
                              work to remove the need for an analytics database for the Fleet Management Portals. My plans 
                              allowed for OLTP and analytics workloads to use the same database, resulting in real-time 
                              operational analytics. Query runtimes after my proposed changes (in the proof of concept) 
                              resulted in final runtimes taking 1% of the original querying time with more accurate data.

                              During my time at Trapeze Group, I worked on an ASP.NET Core MVC project which acted as 
                              the company's internal file explorer. This tool allows employees to download solutions 
                              and tools for personal use or for distribution. From the original code, I was able to 
                              reduce app load times by 18x through code and performance analysis.

                              different web applications. I converted legacy code to follow more modern standards, 
                              such as the use of tag helpers from previous HTML helpers. I created editor and display 
                              templates for various applications. During this term, I worked on both front-end and 
                              backend code.

                            <p>
                                My first co-op opportunity was at RedIron, a company making retail solution innovations. 
                                To get to know some of their products and solutions, my first tasks revolved around 
                                adding features to an application that allows users to create automated scripts for 
                                retail POS solutions. This work involved a lot of learning including how to create well 
                                rounded test cases. While working on this, I was also able to add functionality to older 
                                previously created extensions.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              Upon learning how the various applications worked, my next task was to create a new extension. 
                              This extension enabled communication between a VeriFone device (new to the company), and 
                              drivers using web services.

                              <p>
                                Every fitness timer app I have used has had something awesome I found helpful, however, I 
                                have always wanted a timer that includes the best features from various apps. In turn, I 
                                have started to design my own personal IOS application that I can use at the gym. The app 
                                is still in progress, but it will include all the features I have ever found useful!
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                I have a lot of ideas floating around in my head for the app, however, I started with the 
                                basics. My first goal was to run basic timer types such as For Time, EMOMs, AMRAPs and 
                                Tabataâs. This was done using editable text fields that opened picker views. These picker 
                                views allow for users to select work/rest durations, rounds, and total time to run. I 
                                purposefully made the code for the single timer pickers non-reusable. The first phase of 
                                my app was a fun challenge that familiarized me with Swift.
                              </p>

                              <div>
                                <div class="portfolio-centered-content">
                                  <img src="img/timer/AppTimerSelection.png" class="img-responsive-portfolio" alt="">

                              <p>
                                My next step was to enable users to combine multiple timer types. This involved creating 
                                re-usable code that allows the different timers to use the same pickers and logic blocks. 
                                The app currently has the ability to combine multiple single duration timers implemented. 
                                I am working towards adding the ability for users to join EMOM and Tabata timers with other 
                                timer types.

                                Further goals for my app include adding rest periods between timers, allowing for EMOMs and 
                                Tabata's to be used in the combinational timers, fixing memory leaks and improving the UI 
                                throughout the app. Furthermore, I would love to allow users to record PRs, track strength 
                                progressions and easily determine weight percentages in an easy to use and visually appealing 
                                form. All of these non-timer features would be located in a new tab of the application.

                                instantly captivated while learning how activity trackers and heart rate sensors work.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                I bought an optical heart rate sensor and attached it to an Arduino to see what I could 
                                learn from the signals. I started to write algorithms to detect peaks that correlate to 
                                a heartbeat. With enough peaks, I was able to calculate heart rate variability based on 
                                RMSSD calculations. I also translated these calculations to code.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                My next goal with this project is to prototype a similar optical heart rate sensor on a 
                                PCB, attach it to a board with Bluetooth capabilities and provide information to either 
                                a phone or computer from said board. This work is all out of personal interest and I am 
                                excited to learn how I can reduce the noise resulting from movement and reduce the size 
                                of the contraption.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                I have done a lot of research into the theory behind optical heart rate sensors and the 
                                correlation between heart rate data and health insights. My research includes how devices 
                                track sleep, heart rate, and calories burnt throughout the day.

                              <p>
                                During my second year in University, I took a numerical methods course. My final project 
                                was to address a real-world problem using numerical methods. I decided to analyze a three 
                                joint robotic arm. The joints were simplified to act as hinges and the arm was examined to 
                                determine divergence zones the required angles reach a point in space. I wrote MATLAB 
                                scripts to determine the divergence regions for the system's matrix representation of the 
                                system. I then wrote a C# application capable of determining all possible combinations of 
                                joint angles to reach points in a grid system.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                I rewrote my MATLAB code in a C# console application. I created functions to manipulate 
                                matrices and solve systems of equations. After creating my console application, I wrote a 
                                simple web app to display my results for presentation purposes.
                              </p>

                              <p>
                                The original MATLAB code took more than 24 hours to run. This version accepted a lot amount 
                                of error and took large increments for the step sizes (between points). My C# applications 
                                were able to perform the same calculations with less error and smaller distance increments 
                                between points. This took less than 10 seconds to run and allowed me to run more complicated 
                                scenarios. The program takes the error as a user's input parameter and calculates the angles 
                                to the specified tolerance.

                              <p>
                                During my first year in University, our final project was to make a Lego NXT Robot 
                                that completes a task of any sort. There weren't many specifications for the project, 
                                we had the opportunity to create anything we wanted. My group made a robotic arm that 
                                sorted items of different colours into corresponding boxes. The arm found the ramp 
                                and picked up the next object. Using sensors and motors, the robot determined the 
                                item's colour and placed it into the corresponding bin.
